## Scope

This repository showcases my validated experience with Microsoft Teams administration, reflecting the depth and rigor of a 2–3 year in-role practitioner. All tasks are executed in a live Microsoft 365 tenant, with annotated screenshots and outcome verification to demonstrate real-world accuracy. PowerShell and compliance/security tasks are intentionally excluded to preserve role authenticity and focus on GUI-native workflows within the Teams Admin Center.

## Overview

This project simulates the responsibilities of a dedicated **Microsoft Teams Administrator**, focusing on governance, configuration, access control, policy enforcement, and reporting. Each task is selected to reflect actual admin scenarios encountered in enterprise environments, with attention to licensing boundaries, role permissions, and lifecycle hygiene.

The repository is structured to highlight not just execution, but editorial decision-making — including troubleshooting notes, portal path corrections, and scope boundaries. It is designed as a portfolio artifact to demonstrate hands-on capability, not as a guide or onboarding resource for others.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate **end-to-end Teams administration capabilities** using native portal workflows  
- Showcase **hands-on experience** with validated outcomes and real tenant configurations  
- Reflect **editorial rigor** in task selection, boundary marking, and troubleshooting

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Governance & Lifecycle Management**  
  Naming policies, expiration settings, archival workflows, and team creation controls

- **Team & Channel Configuration**  
  Standard and private channels, moderation settings, and member permissions

- **Role & Access Management**  
  Owner/member roles, guest access controls, and external collaboration boundaries

- **Policy Enforcement**  
  Messaging, meeting, and app permission policies with assignment and validation

- **Collaboration Integration**  
  SharePoint, Planner, and OneNote integration across Teams environments

- **Monitoring & Reporting**  
  Usage analytics, audit log exports, and reporting tasks within licensing scope

## Real-World Use Cases

- Rolling out Microsoft Teams for new departments with scoped creation permissions  
- Applying custom messaging and meeting policies to meet organizational compliance needs  
- Managing guest access securely for external partners while maintaining lifecycle hygiene  
- Monitoring usage trends and audit logs to support governance and adoption decisions

## Editorial Notes

- All portal paths, role requirements, and licensing boundaries are validated against actual tenant experience  
- Troubleshooting notes are included where documentation is misleading or incomplete, especially for role assignment and export limitations
